Manage your code with Git and GitHub - Part 2 - Share a repository on GitHub

This exercise will help to put some of the ideas i have learned during the course section into practice.

- create a simple Git repository containing:

-A file called "README.txt" which presents the project;
-At least 2 other files of your choice (they can contain code scripts, text about a personal project, etc…);
-At least 4 separate commits which show the adding and modification of different files.

Pay attention to your commit messages and try to be very clear. For example, avoid messages like “commit 1”, “commit 2” etc.
\which don’t really explain what you changed, added, or deleted.

Once you’ve created your repository, push it to GitHub, then copy the URL of the repository 
(format: https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject).

Next, download this text document. Add the URL of your repository and save the file.
To send your work, compress the text file as a .zip, and submit that .zip.
